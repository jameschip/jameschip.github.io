<h1>Big-Chip </h1>
Big-Chip was the name under which I released chip music. The name came from a bag of frozen chips that my friend had; when he suggested that it might make a good name for a chip music act I agreed, but it’s a crap name.

<h2>The Big-Chip ep. </h2>

<br>
This was the first Big-Chip release. This was totally lost when the Big-Chip website I was running went down in 2010; around the same time the hard drive that had the files on died. Lucky for me a friend found a copy of it on his backup drive in 2019.
