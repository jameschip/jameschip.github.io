{{ h3 Wiki Engine }}
Currently I find my wiki bulky and unweildy. It's only small but I already see problems going forward as things get bigger.
I am currently writing a wiki engine that will make it easier to navigaate.

{{ h3 Rework The Lizard }}
My custom markup language called The Lizard needs a bit of a birthday. While I loke it I often find that the pages get
filled with \{{ br }} tags, which is something I hate in html. One though is to just convert all \n chars into breaks. The other I 
am thinking is to enclose any blocks of text in paragraph tags on the output. Personally I have been leaning towards the latter.

{{ h3 Website rework }}
I fancy a change around and might start working on a much more minimal and stripped back website design. Colour and images, BE GONE!

{{ h3 Watercolours }}
I have been spending some time experimenting with watercolours.

A short ghost story.

{{ h3 The Wood Heart }}
This game was first published in in*die zine in 2020, I have chosen to go back to this game and expand it, creating a physical release to go with it too.

A Christmas themed card table for {{ li https://jameschip.itch.io/the-adventurer { The Adventurer } }}. 

{{ h3 Very Useful Library Indeed! }}
The very useful library indeed is going to be a small library of micro zines inspired by a micro zine {{ br }} 
{{ li https://jameschip.itch.io/very-useful-spells-indeed { Very Useful Spells Indeed } }} that I created for {{ li https://itch.io/jam/minizinejam2020 { Mini Zine Jam 2020 } }}. I found these mini zines so fun to create I chose to then make a whole tiny library of them.

{{ h3 IndOfTheYear }}
Ind Of The Year is an end of the year (good pun) indie ttrpg (and one video game) bundle. I and 24 other creators have put games into a bundle at an 72% discount. See the bundle {{ li https://tiny.cc/indoftheyear { here } }}. 

{{ h3 Meditation }}
I have started a routine of regular meditation each morning.

{{ h2 November 2020 }}

{{h3  A break! }}
I have been busy and it's been a strange year. I had two weeks after micro fiction games jam ended with noting going on. I chose to take the rest of the month to myself and play some board games. I mostly played 7th Continent.

{{ h3 Micro Fiction Games Jam }}
In November I will be running the first Micro Fiction Games Jam. People who wish to take park will be encouraged to write tabletop games that fit into a single tweet (280 chars) on a theme. I have written the website and created the tooling to generate the individual game pages.

{{ h2 October 2020 }}

{{ h3 Inktober }}
I am currently doing an ink drawing everyday for inktober. I  did start by following the prompts but then realised I was just happier to draw landscapes, so that is what I am doing.
