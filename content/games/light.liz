Light is a journal keeping game about being a sole lighthouse keeper in exceptional circumstances. The two other keepers that were with you on the island have suddenly gone missing, leaving you to run the lighthouse by yourself. As if things couldn't be worse you were due to go back to the main land today and a storm, unlike any you have seen before, has rolled in and will delay your departure. Will you be able to keep the light shining? What happened to your other keepers? 
{{ h2 What you will need. }}
To play this game you will need a standard deck of cards; a tumbling block tower and some counters. The cards will act as an oracle, guiding your daily activities. The tower represents the light, if it falls then the light is allowed to go out and the game ends.
