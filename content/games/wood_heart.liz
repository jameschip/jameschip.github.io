A wood heart is a game I produces for the September 2020 issue of {{ li  https://indie-zine.itch.io { in*die Zine } }}. It is about a group of forest spirits living in a forest where humans have just begun to settle.{{ br }}
{{ br }}
It is a map drawing and story telling game that uses a deck of tarot cards and a die as an oracle to allow the players to tell the stories of the forest spirits.
It is a quiet comment on human activity and the climate emergency that threatens us all.{{ br }}
{{ br }}
The september issue also comes with 9 other games by other creators, a load of other articles and some music so it is well worth picking up a copy.
