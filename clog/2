[4mWhat is thisclog thing?[0m

This is a clog (curl blog = clog); a blog designed to be read using the curl
command from your terminal! Entries on in the blog can be decoreated with 
ansi colour codes like you would in any bash script.

[4mHow go i get my own![0m

Quite simple. Put a directory named "clog" somewhere on your website, this is
where your clog will live. The landing page of all clogs is the 'index' file.
In the index file you should have a list of all of the entries that you have
created in your clog and an id that can be used to read them. The id of
each entry in your clog should be the name of a file in the same directory as
the index file. for an example see:

https://github.com/jameschip/clog

The example contains a bash script that will also create new entries for
you as you go on and append them to the index.

Thats it really, not much else to it!
