[4mCatching ctrl+KEY in ncurses.[0m

So we all know the familiar routine for catching
key presses in ncurses yes.

	char c = getch()
	switch ( c ) {
		case 'a':
			// a was pressed
			break;
		case 'b'
			// b pressed
			break;
	}

But what about if we want to catch Ctrl+KEY? How do
we check for that illusive thing, the Ctrl key?

Well it is actually easier than ou would think.
There is a simple macro that can be used that gives
you access to this functionallity!

	#define ctrl(x) ((x) & 0x1f) // <-- THIS ONE

	char c = getch()
	switch ( c ) {
		case 'a':
			// a was pressed
			break;
		case ctrl( 'a' ):
			// Ctrl+a was pressed
			break;
	}

Thats it, enjoy your ctrl+s for save!
