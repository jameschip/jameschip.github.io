An an absolout shit storm.I did however manage to meet some of my targets. Despite the global <br>pandemic makinig it difficult to get gardening supplies I did manage to do quiute a bit in the garden. I planted a <br>good number of polinator friendly shrubs and plants. I also managed to grow a good ammount of vegetables without<br>resorting to chemical fertilizers.<br><br> </p><p>I did manage to read quite a lot, by my standard, this year and have felt much<br>better for doing so. It is amazing how much of a boost to my mental state reading can give me.<br><br></p><p>I also started to publish small tabletop role playing games. This, in my opiniion has been an umitigated success.<br>Quite a few people have not only played my games, unuxpected, but have enjoyed them too! As it happens I have also <br>rather enjoyed writing them.<br><br></p><p>The final thing I want to add here is that i also wrote a whole load of software; creating my own tools to do things<br>like create this website or keep notes. <br></p>
