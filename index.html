<h1>Now.</h1>

<h2>February 2021 </h2>

<h3>Launch AWood Heart </h3>
Launching the physical and digital copies of the extended version of A Wood Heart.

<h3>Setting up an online shop </h3>
So that people can buy physical zines from me if I have them.

<h3>Wiki Engine </h3>
Currently I find my wiki bulky and unwieldy. It's only small but I already see problems going forward as things get bigger.
I am currently writing a wiki engine that will make it easier to navigate.

<h3>Rework The Lizard </h3>
My custom markup language called The Lizard needs a bit of a birthday. While I like it I often find that the pages get
filled with \<br> tags, which is something I hate in html. One though is to just convert all \n chars into breaks. The other I 
am thinking is to enclose any blocks of text in paragraph tags on the output. Personally I have been leaning towards the latter.

<h3>Website rework </h3>
I fancy a change around and might start working on a much more minimal and stripped back website design. Colour and images, BE GONE!

<h2>January 2021</h2>

<h3>Watercolours </h3>
I have been spending some time experimenting with watercolours.

<h3>The Alder </h3>
A short ghost story.

<h3>The Wood Heart </h3>
This game was first published in in*die zine in 2020, I have chosen to go back to this game and expand it, creating a physical release to go with it too.

<h2>December 2020 </h2>

<h3>Coda </h3>
Coda is an in progress game about alien civilisations and sheet music.

<h3>Learning LaTex </h3>
Learning LaTex to use it to lay out small ttrpg projects.

<h3>The ADVENTure </h3>
A Christmas themed card table for <a href="https://jameschip.itch.io/the-adventurer">{ The Adventurer } </a>. 

<h3>Very Useful Library Indeed! </h3>
The very useful library indeed is going to be a small library of micro zines inspired by a micro zine <br> 
<a href="https://jameschip.itch.io/very-useful-spells-indeed">{ Very Useful Spells Indeed } </a> that I created for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/minizinejam2020">{ Mini Zine Jam 2020 } </a>. I found these mini zines so fun to create I chose to then make a whole tiny library of them.

<h3>IndOfTheYear </h3>
Ind Of The Year is an end of the year (good pun) indie ttrpg (and one video game) bundle. I and 24 other creators have put games into a bundle at an 72% discount. See the bundle <a href="https://tiny.cc/indoftheyear">{ here } </a>. 

<h3>Meditation </h3>
I have started a routine of regular meditation each morning.

<h2>November 2020 </h2>

<h3>A break! </h3>
I have been busy and it's been a strange year. I had two weeks after micro fiction games jam ended with noting going on. I chose to take the rest of the month to myself and play some board games. I mostly played 7th Continent.

<h3>Micro Fiction Games Jam </h3>
In November I will be running the first Micro Fiction Games Jam. People who wish to take park will be encouraged to write tabletop games that fit into a single tweet (280 chars) on a theme. I have written the website and created the tooling to generate the individual game pages.

<h2>October 2020 </h2>

<h3>Inktober </h3>
I am currently doing an ink drawing everyday for inktober. I  did start by following the prompts but then realised I was just happier to draw landscapes, so that is what I am doing.
